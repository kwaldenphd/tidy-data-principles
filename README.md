# SQL Query Syntax

As described in Library Carpentry's [Introduction to SQL tutorial](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-sql/01-introduction/index.html), "Structured Query Language, or SQL (sometimes pronounced 'sequel'), is a powerful language used to interrogate and manipulate relational databases. It is not a general programming language that you can use to write an entire program."

When working in a relational database, we an use SQL to write queries.

As described in Library Carpentry's [Introduction to SQL tutorial](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-sql/01-introduction/index.html), "a query is a question or request for data. For example, “How many journals does our library subscribe to?” When we query a database, we can ask the same question using a common language called Structured Query Language or SQL in what is called a statement. Some of the most useful queries - the ones we are introducing in this first section - are used to return results from a table that match specific criteria."

This section of the lab will introduce some basic elements of SQL syntax. 

## Selecting and Sorting
```SQL
SELECT [field]
FROM [table];
```

97- The `SELECT` query selects a specific field (column) from a specific table.

98- The semicolon `;` is required at the end of every SQL query.

99- Adding multiple columns after `SELECT` will return data from multiple columns.

```SQL
SELECT [field_1], [field_2], [field_3]
FROM [table];
```

<blockquote>Q20: How would you write an SQL query to select the list of player ids and birthplace countries from the Player_Birthplaces table? What data does this query return?</blockquote>

100- We might want to write a query to return all the unique values in a particular field.

101- For example, selecting the entire `country` field in the `Player_Birthplaces` table would return many duplicate values.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT [field]
FROM [table];
```

102- `SELECT DISTINCT` returns a list of unique values.

<blockquote>Q21: How would you write an SQL query to return the unique list of player birthplace countries from the Player_Birthplaces table? What data does this query return?</blockquote>

103- We might also want to sort the results returned by a query.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM [table]
ORDER BY [field] ASC;
```

104- The `*` wildcard operator selects all the fields in a specific table.

105- `ORDER BY` specifies a field to use in sorting the query results.

106- `ASC` returns ascending results. `DESC` would return descending results.

<blockquote>Q22: How would you write an SQL query to return the unique list of team names from the Team_Locations table, sorted in reverse alphabetical order? What data does this query return?</blockquote>

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM [table]
ORDER BY [field_1] ASC, [field_2] DESC;
```

107- We can also sort on multiple fields.

108- In the query above, the `ORDER BY` statement sorts `[field_1]` first (ascending) and then sorts `[field_2]` (descending).

<blockquote>Q23: How would you write an SQL query to return the data from the Player_Birthplaces table, sorted in chronological order by birth year and reverse alphabetical order by country? What data does this query return?</blockquote>

## Filtering

109- Sometimes we may only want to return values that fall within a specific range or based on a particular set of conditions.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM [Player_Birthplaces]
WHERE country='DO';
```

110- This query returns all columns from the `Player_Birthplaces` table where data in the `country` field is equal to `DO`.

111- The data returned by this query includes all the records for players born in the Dominican Republic.

112- We can also use operators to specify a range for the `WHERE` clause.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM [Player_Birthplaces]
WHERE dob>1996;
```

113- This query returns all columns from `Player_Birthplaces` where data in the `dob` field is greater than `1996`.

List of operators that can be used in a `WHERE` clause (from W3Schools [SQL Where Clause page](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp)).

114- SQL query syntax requires single quotes around text values. Numeric fields do not need single quotes.

<blockquote>Q24: How would you write an SQL query to return the data from the Team_Locations table for teams located in states that start with the letter M? What data does this query return?</blockquote>

## Aggregating and Calculating

We won't cover these functions in this lab, but SQL syntax includes functions that can group query results by particular fields and perform basic arithmetic functions on values in a database.

To learn more, visit Library Carpentry's [Aggregating & calculating values page](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-sql/04-aggregating-calculating/index.html) and W3Schools' [SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) pages for specific aggregating and calculating functions.
